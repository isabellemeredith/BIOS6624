# Introduction

The data for this project come from the prospective cohort study, Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, which investigates the natural and treated courses of HIV-1 in gay and bisexual men in four major US cities. This study focuses on the subset of the data where participants were prescribed highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART), the standard treatment for HIV-1. Measures of physical and mental health were taken at baseline before treatment and annually each year after for eight years. The goal of this secondary analysis is to examine whether there is a difference in treatment efficacy at two years after treatment initiation between subjects who were using hard drugs at baseline and subjects who were not. The outcomes of interest in this analysis are viral load, CD4+ T cell count, an aggregate physical quality of life score, and an aggregate mental quality of life score. 

The purpose of this report is to develop the analysis plan to investigate the following hypothesis:

1.Hypothesis: Treatment response to HAART as measured by viral load, CD4+ T cell count, an aggregate physical quality of life score, and an aggregate mental quality of life score is lower in subjects who were hard drug users at baseline than in subjects who were not.

# Methods

## Data Cleaning

The dataset was filtered to include only subjects that had values at baseline and year 2. This yielded 506 subjects. 

Viral load was log transformed as it is very right skewed by high values. 



List any data cleaning that will be required (or has already been done). This would include new representation of variables (collapsing groups) and observations that had to be removed, etc.  

## Data Analysis
For the project as a whole, and for each research question, aim, or hypothesis, describe the proposed analytic method and any necessary details for its implementation. At a minimum, this should address the hypotheses mentioned above. For further detail, describe any follow up or secondary analyses, any assessments of assumptions, and sensitivity or subgroup analyses. Do not forget to include treatment of missing data. This section should have enough detail that any statistician could recreate the analysis using any statistical software and the source data. 

Example:

*A univariable analysis between outcomes and exposure and outcomes and covariates/confounders will be performed using general linear regression. Assumptions of linearity, homoscedasticity, and normality will be confirmed using diagnostic plots. A complete case analysis will be used for each model. Covariates with a significant association with the outcome will be used for adjustment in a multivariable model. P values <0.05 will be considered significant. Baseline FEV, gender, and age will be included in the adjusted model based on their biological associations with the outcome. Since participants were randomly assigned, there should be no relationship between possible covariates and exposure, this will be confirmed using χ2/fisher’s exact for categorical covariates and ANOVA for continuous covariates.*



# Preliminary Results

First paragraph are descriptive statistics and graphs with a description of the patterns of importance in a table/figures describing the data. This may be provided in a data analysis plan if you have gotten this far. It would not be included in a formal clinical trial data analysis plan, which happens before the data are even collected.

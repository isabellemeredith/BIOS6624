# Introduction

The data for this project come from the prospective cohort study, Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, which investigates the natural and treated courses of HIV-1 in gay and bisexual men in four major US cities. This study focuses on the subset of the data where participants were prescribed highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART), the standard treatment for HIV-1. Measures of physical and mental health were taken at baseline before treatment and annually each year after for eight years. The goal of this secondary analysis is to examine whether there is a difference in treatment efficacy at two years after treatment initiation between subjects who were using hard drugs at baseline and subjects who were not. The outcomes of interest in this analysis are viral load, CD4+ T cell count, an aggregate physical quality of life score, and an aggregate mental quality of life score. 

The purpose of this report is to develop the analysis plan to investigate the following hypothesis:

1.Hypothesis: Treatment response to HAART as measured by viral load, CD4+ T cell count, an aggregate physical quality of life score, and an aggregate mental quality of life score is lower in subjects who were hard drug users at baseline than in subjects who were not.

# Methods

## Data Cleaning

The dataset was filtered to include only subjects that had values at baseline and year 2. This yielded 506 subjects. 18 subjects who were either missing BMI values or had BMI values that were negative or greater than 100 were removed from analysis, leaving 488 subjects. Additionally, 7 subjects were missing either the baseline or year 2 aggregate scores for physical and mental, and will be removed from those analyses, yielding 481 subjects for those models. 14 subjects were missing either the baseline or year 2 viral loads and CD4+ T cell counts, and will be removed from those analyses, yielding 474 subjects for those models. Viral load was log transformed as viral loads can vary from tenths of a copy per mL to millions of copies per mL.

## Data Analysis

A univariable analysis between each of the four outcomes at year two and hard drug use at baseline will be performed using general linear regression in both a frequentist and a Bayesian framework. The frequentist and Bayesian analyses will be conducted separately. Assumptions of linearity, homoscedasticity, and normality will be confirmed using diagnostic plots. A complete case analysis will be used for each model. P values <0.05 will be considered significant. The baseline value for the outcome of each model will included in the model as adjustment. Age, BMI, smoking, race, adherence to treatment, and education will be included as covariates due to their relevance in outcomes in previous studies. The Bayesian models will use non-informative normal priors for each of the beta coefficients and a half Cauchy for the residual standard error.
